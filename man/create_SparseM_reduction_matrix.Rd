\title{Helper function to slm_fit_csr}
\usage{
create_SparseM_reduction_matrix(zeroes)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{logical vector indicating which entries of x'x are zeroes.}
}
\value{
SparseM matrix that will reduce the dimension of x'x and xy
}
\description{
This function generates a matrix that can be used to reduce
the dimensions of x'x and xy such that positive definiteness is
ensured and more practically, that SparseM::chol will work
}
